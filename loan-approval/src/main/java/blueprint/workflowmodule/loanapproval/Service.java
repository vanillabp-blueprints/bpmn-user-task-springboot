/**
 * The business service of this use case: what the application can do with a loan approval,
 * expressed without a single word about processes.
 *
 * <p>
 * It never touches VanillaBP. Whenever the business case moves on, it tells {@link Workflow}
 * what happened, {@code riskAssessed} rather than "complete the user task", and that class
 * decides what this means for the BPMN. The other direction runs through
 * {@link WorkflowTaskHandler}, which calls the methods below when the process reaches a
 * task.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A user task splits its handling in two, and both halves are here: the process reports
 * that somebody has to assess the risk ({@link #riskAssessmentOpened}), and much later the
 * application reports the answer ({@link #assessRisk}). Nothing keeps the two together but
 * the task id on the workflow aggregate.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Note where {@code @Transactional} sits. It is on the methods the API calls, because
 * starting a workflow and answering a user task have to run in a transaction. It is
 * deliberately absent from the methods a task handler calls: VanillaBP already runs a task
 * in a transaction it owns, and a transaction declared here would break the guarantees that
 * come with it. VanillaBP sees such a transaction and fails the task naming it, so the
 * mistake shows up rather than costing data.
 * </p>
