# bpmn-user-task

Adds a user task: the workflow waits for a person, the application keeps the task's id and
later completes or cancels the task with it. A delta on top of `module-single`.

## Placeholders

Replace all of these consistently; they are the same in every blueprint.

Blueprint-specific names, each occurring in more than one place:

|       Name       |                                                    Where it occurs                                                     |
|------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `assessRisk`     | the `@WorkflowTask` method, the Camunda 7 `camunda:formKey` and the Camunda 8 `zeebe:formDefinition externalReference` |
| `loan-withdrawn` | the constant `Workflow.LOAN_WITHDRAWN` and the `errorCode` of `bpmn:error` in the model                                |
| `informCustomer` | the `@WorkflowTask` method behind the user task and the task definition of that service task                           |
| `noteWithdrawal` | the `@WorkflowTask` method on the error path and the task definition of that service task                              |

Which BPMN attribute of a user task carries the task definition is BPMS-specific, so the two
models name it differently while both mean `assessRisk`. The error code is the contract
between code and model: if the two drift apart, the canceled task is not caught by the
boundary event and the workflow ends as an incident.

## Adding this blueprint to an existing project

1. Add the user task to the BPMN and give it the task definition the BPMS reads it from
   (`camunda:formKey` for Camunda 7, `zeebe:formDefinition externalReference` together with
   `zeebe:userTask` for Camunda 8, see the adapter's wiki). If the application has to be
   able to cancel the task, attach an error boundary event and declare a `bpmn:error` whose
   `errorCode` is the string the code will pass.
2. Add an attribute for the task id to the workflow aggregate. Without it the task cannot
   be answered later, because its id is the only handle to it.
3. Add a `@WorkflowTask` method named after the task definition to `WorkflowTaskHandler`. It
   takes the aggregate, `@TaskId` for the id and `@TaskEvent` to tell creation from
   cancellation, and it calls `Service` for each of the two. Do not complete the task there
   and never throw `TaskException` in it: there is nothing to complete by BPMN error at
   creation time.
4. Add the business methods to `Service`: one storing the id and doing whatever notifies the
   people who have to act, one dropping the id when the task was canceled, and one per
   answer the API accepts. Annotate the API-facing ones with `@Transactional`, never the
   ones the task handler calls.
5. Have the answering methods reject a task id which is not the one stored on the aggregate.
   A task id reaches the application as a link somebody kept, so it outlives the task.
6. Add `completeUserTask` and `cancelUserTask` calls to `Workflow`, one method per business
   event, and keep the BPMN error code there as a constant.
7. Add GET endpoints for the answers, carrying the task id in the path, and log the URLs
   continuing the process when the task is created.
8. Copy `LoanApprovalIT` and write one test per way the task ends.

A user task without a handler is allowed: the wiring validation does not ask for one,
because such a task is meant to be worked on through a form or a task list. Add the handler
when the application has to know about the task, which is the case as soon as it wants to
complete it itself.

## Verifying

```bash
mvn install verify
```

That runs on Camunda 7, which is embedded and needs no infrastructure. `-Pcamunda8` needs a
running cluster and `vanillabp.adapters.camunda8.rest-address` configured; do not report a
failure of that profile as a defect of the generated code before having checked it.

`LoanApprovalIT` proves the aspect and has to pass:

- the aggregate carries the task id, and the service task behind the user task has not run,
  so the workflow really waits,
- after `completeUserTask` the service task behind the user task has run,
- after `cancelUserTask` the service task on the error path has run and the stored id is
  gone, which is the cancellation notification having arrived.

The third one only runs where the BPMS supports canceling a user task. The root POM hands
the BPMS of the build to the tests as the system property `blueprint.bpms`, and the test is
annotated accordingly; a build reporting it as skipped is not a defect.

If a task is never executed, the wiring between BPMN and code is wrong, and the startup log
names which BPMN task has no method or which method has no task. If the workflow ends in an
incident instead of taking the error path, the error code in the code and the one in the
model differ.

Do not report success without having run this.
